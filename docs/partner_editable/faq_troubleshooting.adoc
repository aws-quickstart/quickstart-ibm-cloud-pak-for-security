== Troubleshooting

*Q.* I encountered a CREATE_FAILED error when I launched the Quick Start.

*A.* If AWS CloudFormation fails to create the stack, we recommend that you relaunch the template with *Rollback on failure* set to *No*. (This setting is under *Advanced* in the AWS CloudFormation console, *Options* page.) With this setting, the stackâ€™s state will be retained and the instance will be left running, so you can troubleshoot the issue. (Look at the log files in %ProgramFiles%\Amazon\EC2ConfigService and C:\cfn\log.)

*Important* When you set *Rollback on failure* to *No*, you will continue to incur AWS charges for this stack. Make sure to delete the stack when you finish troubleshooting.

For additional information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html[Troubleshooting AWS CloudFormation] on the AWS website.

*Q.* I encountered a size limitation error when I deployed the AWS CloudFormation templates.

*A.* We recommend that you launch the Quick Start templates from the links in this guide or from another S3 bucket. If you deploy the templates from a local copy on your computer or from a non-S3 location, you might encounter template size limitations when you create the stack. For more information about AWS CloudFormation limits, see the http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cloudformation-limits.html[AWS documentation].

*Q.* I am not able to delete the stack that I created from the Quick Start.

*A.* We recommend that you clean up the registry bucket in your S3 account and retry deleting the stack.

*Q.* My QuickStart is hanging during the CREATE stage of the stack

*A.* Various log files are generated and it's good to have a reference on where/what they are.

* /s3_logs.txt - Initial CloudFormation S3 Bucket copy of resources to run the QuickStart
* /bootstrap_logs.txt - STDOUT from the bootstrap.sh script
* /ibm/i.log - STDOUT from the install of the product
* /ibm/openshift_install.log - STDOUT of the openshift-install IPI
* /ibm/cp4s_install.log - STDOUT of the CP4S install scripts
* /ibm/cp4s_install_logs.log - STDOUT of the CP4S install scripts
